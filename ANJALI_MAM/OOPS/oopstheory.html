    oops : object oriented programming system

    1) class
    2) object
    3) inheritance
    4) polymorphism.


    => class : class is a undefined data type
    class is a collection of data member and member function :



    e.g. PYTHON_WHATSAPP_GROUP (CLASS)

    -->gaurav (data members)
    -->sandhya
    -->arma
    -->kruti...


    -message (member function / method)
    -remove
    -add
    -creategroup



    -admin (object)


    => object : object is an instance or variable of class using of object we can access properties of class
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------->

    visiblity modes or access specifier:
    there are three types of access specifier:
    1) private : which is only access by own class
    2) public : which is access ny oen and other class
    3) protected : which is access by own class and child class

    varible access specifer:
    there are two ways to define varible (member) in class

    1)partial private : which is represent by_varname in prefix (traditional)
    2)truly private : which is represent by #varname (declare in ES6)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------>

    inheritance : one class deriverd proprties of another class its called inheritance

    - using of inheritance we can reduce our code.

    - inheritance provide reusability.

    - using of inheritance we can save our time.

    inheritance only possible with extend keyword.

    1)parent class / base class / super class.

    i
    v

    2) child class / derived class /sub class

    here, child class can be access properties of parent class
    always create object of child(derived)class

    ====>>> constructor overriding : when parent and child both have same constructor it will overriding
    constructor

            this(): refer current class properties.
            super(): using of super keyword we can access specific parent's proprties.


    ====>> types of inheritance 
    1) classical inheritance 
    
    class A
    {

    }
    class B extends A 
    {

    }

    2) prototypical inheritance :

    create object of another class and extends properties.
    
    
==========================================================================>>>

encapsulation : encapsulation is the most important concept in the oops.

it similar like capsule 
wrap data member and member function.

--> data hidden.

--> getter and setter.



polymorphism : poly  means  many and morphism means forms

              polymorphism is derived from greek word.

              which means one named method has different different forms.

              e.g. 
                   :- mother 
                   :- wife 
                   :- child 

             there are two types of polymorphism.

    1) method overloading :            
               one class have same name method with different arguments.


               e.g  class syudent 
               {
                display ()
                {

                }
                display( int id)
                {

                }
               }

          note: javascript does nt support method overloading concept.
          
    2) method overriding :  
    
          when parents and child both have same name method its called method overriding.



   ===========================================================>>>
   abstraction concept : abstraction which is reprsent only few information not allocated background information
   
                   abstraction which is contain only method declaration
                   without body.

                   child can implement that abstract method.
